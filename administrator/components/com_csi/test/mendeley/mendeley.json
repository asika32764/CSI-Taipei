Filial piety, the core idea of Confucian ethics for ordinary people, is explained in the context of my previous analysis of the structure of Confucianism (Hwang, 1995). The social consequences of practicing Confucian ethics for ordinary people in the agricultural society of traditional China are illustrated with Fei’s (1948) concept of differential structure and F. L. K. Hsu’s (1971) psychosociogram. The concept of loyalty is contrasted with filial piety with reference to the optimal distinctiveness theory. Empirical studies are cited to illuminate the psychological implications of holding filial attitudes and of the modification of filiaty under the impact of modernization. Finally, suggestions for future research are offered based on current analysis of issues related to this topic.

The second part presents an analysis of Confucian ethics (Hwang, 1995), and proposes a conceptual scheme for discerning the significant features of Confucian ethics by referring to distinctions between positive/negative and imperfect/perfect duties. The discretionary features of Confucian ethics are further analyzed in terms of Shweder et al.’s (1990) scheme for discerning a rationally defensible moral code. In addition, the Confucian moral dilemma and its modern fate in the New-Culture Movement of the May Fourth period on mainland China, and the 1960s Gong De Movement in Taiwan are discussed. The third part of this paper reinterprets the findings of several empirical studies on moral reasoning in Taiwanese society. Special attention is paid to Cheng’s (1991) data from interviews with a group of college students using Kohlberg’s moral dilemma.

Using the technique of paired comparison, the first study indicated that college students (who are preparing to enter the job market) feel that they ‘‘have face’’ most when they do well in their academic performance, followed by being morally upright. Retirees (who have withdrawn from the workplace) feel that they ‘‘have face’’ most when their children are morally upright and successful in their careers. The second study (on patterns of emotional reactions of related others to an agent’s social and moral incidents) showed, first, that incidents of positive achievement were generally evaluated by college students as being experienced with a more intense feeling of having face than were incidents of positive morality, while incidents of negative morality were experienced with a more intense feeling of ‘‘having no face’’ than were incidents of negative achievement. Second, for a positive incident of having face, the intensity of emotional reaction experienced by acquaintances was generally lower than that of family members. The difference was not so strong as in the negative incident of having no face. The third study (which was a cross-cultural one on cognitive distortion caused by misconduct of related others) indicated that American college students tended to adopt a consistent standard to judge the wrongness of illegal behaviours, regardless of their relationships with the transgressor. But Taiwanese college students tended to judge an illegal behaviour as more wrong when it was done by a person outside the family, while they held a more lenient attitude towards the misconduct of parents, and a similar or more harsh attitude towards their children.

A review of recent research shows that Chinese society and other similar societies follow rules that deviate from those of the West. In such societies, norms of reciprocity (bao) are intense, but these norms are heavily shaped by the hierarchically structured network of social relations (guanxi) in which people are embedded, by the public nature of obligations, and by the long time period over which obligations are incurred through a self-conscious manipula- tion of face and related symbols. These special cultural symbols, as well as the historical monopoly of valuable resources by powerful leaders, help explain the origin of these patterns. There are several forces leading to change but also some sources of continuity, which help maintain these patterns regardless of political and economic contex"},{"title":"From anticolonialism to postcolonialism: The emergence of Chinese indigenous psychology in Taiwan","type":"generic","authors":[{"first_name":"Kwang‐Kuo","last_name":"Hwang"}],"year":2005,"source":"International Journal of Psychology","identifiers":{"issn":"0020-7594","scopus":"2-s2.0-23844479922","doi":"10.1080/00207590444000177"},"pages":"228-238","volume":"40","issue":"4","month":8,"day":1,"id":"edbc0937-50b8-342b-ac8d-4dd0b053b3f8","file_attached":false,"link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/anticolonialism-postcolonialism-emergence-chinese-indigenous-psychology-taiwan","reader_count":10,"reader_count_by_academic_status":{"Assistant Professor":2,"Ph.D. Student":2,"Student (Postgraduate)":1,"Student (Master)":3,"Senior Lecturer":1},"reader_count_by_subdiscipline":{"Psychology":{"Social Psychology":1,"Miscellaneous":5,"Clinical and Counselling Psychology":1},"Linguistics":{"Applied Linguistics":1},"Sports and Recreation":{"Tourism":1}},"reader_count_by_country":{"Brazil":1},"group_count":1,"abstract":"This article gives a brief history of the emergence of Chinese indigenous psychology from the background of Westernized social psychology in Taiwan, and reviews the various debates that have surrounded the first decade of its progress from the perspectives of ontology, epistemology, and methodology. Careful analysis of these debates indicates that their themes are similar to dilemmas encountered by indigenous psychologists in other regions of the world. It is argued that breakthroughs need to be made on three levels for the development of indigenous psychology, namely, philosophical reflection, theoretical construction, and empirical research. There are three philosophical assumptions in cross-cultural psychology—absolutism, universalism, and relativism—which correspond to three research orientations—imposed etic, derived etic, and emic. In order to achieve the goal of establishing a global psychology, then indigenous psychologists in non-Western societies must change their thinking from anticolonialism to postcolonialism; switch their philosophical assumption from relativism to universalism; assimilate the Western academic tradition; adopt a multiparadigm approach to construct formal theories on the functioning and mechanisms of the universal mind; use these to analyse the specific mentalities of a given culture; and use the results of this theoretical construction as a frame of reference for empirical research."},{"title":"The Deep Structure of Confucianism: A social psychological approach","type":"generic","authors":[{"first_name":"Kwang-Kuo","last_name":"Hwang"}],"year":2001,"source":"Asian Philosophy","identifiers":{"issn":"0955-2367","isbn":"0955-2367\\r1469-2961","scopus":"2-s2.0-0037916621","doi":"10.1080/09552360120116928"},"pages":"179-204","volume":"11","issue":"3","month":11,"day":1,"id":"2c5c57a5-e298-3ddc-b766-0c91d3a86533","file_attached":false,"link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/deep-structure-confucianism-social-psychological-approach","reader_count":12,"reader_count_by_academic_status":{"Ph.D. Student":4,"Student (Postgraduate)":1,"Student (Master)":1,"Student (Bachelor)":4},"reader_count_by_subdiscipline":{"Arts and Literature":{"Culture Heritage":1},"Social Sciences":{"Miscellaneous":3},"Psychology":{"Miscellaneous":1,"Developmental Psychology":1,"Cross Cultural Psychology":1},"Management Science / Operations Research":{"Miscellaneous":1},"Business Administration":{"Miscellaneous":2}},"reader_count_by_country":{"United Kingdom":1},"group_count":0,"abstract":"The deep structure of Confucianism is identi? ed through structuralist analysis in order to provide a conceptual framework for conducting social psychological research in Chinese society.

Ethics for ordinary people adopts the principle of Respecting the Superior for procedural justice and the principle of Favouring the Intimate for distributive justice; the person who occupies the superior position should play the role of decision-maker and should allocate resources by favouring intimate relationships.

Design/Methodology/Approach – In consideration of the difficulties faced by either an imposed etic approach or a derived etic approach, this chapter advocates for an emic approach that argues that, in order to understand the specific features of organizational dynamics in China, it is necessary for us to construct an objective system of knowledge (epistemology) on the basis of Chinese cultural values (ontology), which can be examined by methods of social sciences (methodology). Findings – Based on the theoretical model of Face and Favor, a conceptual scheme was proposed to highlight the contrast between Confucianism and Legalism in traditional as well as contemporary Chinese society. Findings of pervious empirical researches on two types of guanxi, along with two types of official and ethical leadership in Chinese organizations were reviewed to demonstrate the usage of yin/yang balance in strategic management.

Three of my theoretical models, namely, my Face and Favor model (Hwang, 1987), Confucian ethics for ordinary people (Hwang, 1995), and a conflict resolution model (Hwang, 1997-8), are conceived of as microworlds for illustrating an account of person-in relations in Chinese culture.

A series of empirical research have been conducted to demonstrate several main propositions derived from the current theoretical model addressing vertical distinctiveness and personal goal; intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation; three types of life goals and their signifi cances in Confucian society; social pressure and personal effort in academic vs. talented performance; and the moral signifi cance of efforts in Chinese society."},{"title":"The Mandala Model of Self","type":"generic","authors":[{"first_name":"Kwang-Kuo","last_name":"Hwang"}],"year":2011,"source":"Psychological Studies","identifiers":{"doi":"10.1007/s12646-011-0110-1","isbn":"1264601101101","issn":"0033-2968","scopus":"2-s2.0-84875937267"},"pages":"329-334","volume":"56","issue":"4","month":12,"day":1,"id":"b3e1fa85-bfc5-36a5-ad6e-d9b6bbd6c4b2","file_attached":false,"link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/mandala-model-self","reader_count":3,"reader_count_by_academic_status":{"Ph.D. Student":1,"Student (Bachelor)":2},"reader_count_by_subdiscipline":{"Psychology":{"Miscellaneous":2},"Computer and Information Science":{"Miscellaneous":1}},"group_count":0,"abstract":"The research by Hendrich et al.

Compared with the WEIRD samples, most of the world’s population is non-Weird. Therefore, the most important mission of Asian indigenous psychology is to initiate a scientific revolution by constructing various kinds of theoretical models to describe psychological phenomenon and behavior of people from non-Weird countries.

Teachers administer more punishments to students violating moral rules, while administering more rewards than punishments for performance in the academic domain. This research was aimed at studying the legitimacy of teachers' use of rewards and punishments, as perceived by students, in moral and academic domains in Taiwan. In this study, scenario questions were used to survey 119 junior high school students in Taipei, and found that the pattern of using rewards and punishments in the moral domain is similar to that of the West. That is, students who practice positive duties do not need to be rewarded, while those who violate negative duties should be punished. The patterns of using rewards and punishments in academic domains of the West are quite different from those of Confucian society. Participants in this research thought that teachers should give more punishments to those effortless students, than those putting forth great effort, but with low academic achievement. They also thought teachers should apply more blame than recording a demerit. When students performed well in academic domains, only those students who made efforts should be rewarded, and teachers should give more rewards to such effortful students than effortless students. The above results can be inferred from students' and teachers' role-obligations in Confucian society. Learning hard is a student's obligation, and guiding students to obtain higher academic achievements is a teacher's duty. The arguments in this research can be generalized to the patterns of the use of punishments in educational situations in Confucian society.

After that, Ss' responses to a questionnaire on procedural justice (PRJ) and DSJ were subjected to factor analysis with promax rotation resulting in a 5-factor solution. It was found that the PRJ and DSJ factors were significantly correlated. To examine relationships between justice and work attitudes, partial correlation analyses showed that distributive fairness was significantly related to all 7 measures of work attitudes, namely, evaluations of supervisor, trust in supervisor, job satisfaction, intentions to quit, interpersonal conflicts, anxiety, cognitive adaptation. In contrast, participation, a form of PRJ, was related to evaluations of supervisor, trust in supervisor, and job satisfaction. These findings suggested that DSJ was more powerful than PRJ in prediction of work attitudes of employees in businesses of Taiwan. It was also found that the most important measure of PRJ in predicting work attitude of employees in Taiwan was the expression of their job difficulties.

Kim and Berry (1993) define indigenous psychology \"the scientific study of human behavior or mind that is native, that is not transported from other regions, and that is designed for its people\" (p. 2). Indigenous psychology advocates examining knowledge, skills, and beliefs people have about themselves and studying these aspects in their natural contexts. Theories, concepts, and methods are developed to correspond with psychological phenomena. It advocates examining explicitly the content and context of research. Culture represents the collective utilization of natural and human resources to achieve desired outcomes; this is the process definition of culture (Kim, 2001). Differences in cultures can exist if people pursue different goals, utilize different methods and resources to realize the goals, and attach different meaning and values on them. Cultural similarities can exist if people pursue similar goals, utilize similar methods and resources to attain the goal, and attach similar meaning and values on them. Collective goals, human and natural resources, method of achieving the goals, and meaning and values attached to them are integrated to form a meaningful and coherent whole.

The present research was designed to reveal the culture level factor structure of social axioms and its correlates across 41 nations. An ecological factor analysis on the 60 items of the Social Axioms Survey extracted two factors: Dynamic Externality correlates with value measures tapping collectivism, hierarchy, and conservatism and with national indices indicative of lower social development. Societal Cynicism is less strongly and broadly correlated with previous values measures or other national indices and seems to define a novel cultural syndrome. Its national correlates suggest that it taps the cognitive component of a cultural constellation labeled maleficence, a cultural syndrome associated with a general mistrust of social systems and other people. Discussion focused on the meaning of these national level factors of beliefs and on their relationships with individual level factors of belief derived from the same data set.
